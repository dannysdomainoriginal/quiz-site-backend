The goal is to give my old quiz site a backend

All user quizzes are stored internally in the user doc
The quiz presets are transferred to a mongodb 'questions' collectiions

The current routes are: 
- auth ( post ): login, register, logout, refresh
- /quiz ( post ) : add quiz
- /quiz ( get ) : generate quiz
- /user/quizzes ( get ) : get user quizzes
- /user/data ( get ) : get user info for sidebar
- user details are decrypted from jwt on frontend

The notification system is the browser window.alert().
